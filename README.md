# Get off my lawn ! 

### Nah, I'm just kidding, you can stay.
I'm matherose, I'm 23, a developer and systems administrator... single and incredibly handsome (listen, nothing ventured, nothing gained).

My everyday motto is "Light is right".

I use as little technology as possible, which may improve the developer's quality of life, but stifles the software's performance.
If I can do it in C or Bash, then I don't need anything else, but don't worry, I know how to use all the trendy DevOps tools (at some point I have to eat too).

Oh, and by the way, I'm addicted to coffee, so if you want to talk to me or seduce me (don't forget, I'm always interested), you've earned points.
