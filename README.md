# Welcome to my virtual playground! ☕️

Hey there, I'm **Matherose**, a 24-year-old French developer and system administrator hailing from the land of baguettes and croissants. But trust me, it's not all clichés! (except that I'm incredibly handsome 🤌✨... but single 😭)

## My Mantra: "Light is Right" 💡

I'm a firm advocate of using the most minimal technologies to supercharge the performance of my software. I don't mind investing extra time in it—some might even wonder if I have a hidden passion for BDSM, but rest assured, my penchant is for software optimization. I'm always up for the challenge, especially when GCC pushes my limits 😏

## Code and Coffee ☕️

Give me C or Shell/Bash, and I'm ready to rock. But don't worry, I can harness all those trendy DevOps tools when the situation calls for it (I will always need to eat and feed my cat 😿)

If you want to chat or even attempt to seduce me (i'm still single btw 👀) with a coffee or anything with caffeine, you've just scored some major points. Let's code and caffeinate together! 🚀
